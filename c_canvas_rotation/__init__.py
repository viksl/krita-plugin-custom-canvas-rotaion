Default shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + D
Description:
  - Free plugin for Krita <https://krita.org) -
  Krita's canvas rotation is currently bound to the center, which means
  no matter where on screen your cursor is the angle is always calculated
  towards the screen/window centre. This means that to rotate cans the
  cursor has to move across the whole screen for a full 360Â° rotation
  or you have to move the cursor closer to the center of the screen
  to use shorter circular movement for the rotation.
  This plugin introduces a new shortcut and a semi-new function which
  utilizes Krita's original canvas rotation but instead of having 
  window/screen as a centre for the rotation gizmo the cursor's position
  at the moment of shortcut activation is utilized as the gizmo's centre.

  Current active layer gets locked to avoid any accidental strokes during
  the rotation. The layer's original state (lock) is stored and restored
  after the rotation automatically there's no need to manually lock/unlock
  the layer.

  Note: Do not misunderstand. This does not rotate the canvas around the
        cursor, canvas rotation in Krita always works around the centre
        of your screen, this plugin on introduces a custom gizmo with the
        rotation.
        With smaller tablets/screens you might have not noticed a need for
        this but with larger screen if you work in on a side of your screen
        and want to rotate the canvas you still have to move the cursor
        around the centre of the screen which means a huge movemvet across
        half or the entire screen, this plugin mitigates this as mentioned
        above.

  !IMPORTANT!
  Changes you can make manually to this plugin:
  1. Locate the file __init__.py inside c_canvas_rotation directory.
  2. Open in a text editor of your choice.
  3. At the top on lines 74 and 81 you will find constants:
      DISTANCE_BUFFER and TIMER_INTERVAL
  4. Increase/decrease (can't be negative!) DISTANCE_BUFFER (pixels radius)
      to grow/shrink area when the rotation is not responsive until the
      cursor leaves this area for the first time (after that the area
      is disabled and the rotation is allowed everywhere)
  5.  Increase/decrease (can't be negative!) TIMER_INTERVAL (milliseconds)
      to increase/decrease how smooth the ccustom canvas rotaion is.
      The lower the smoother experience but more cpu intensive (overall it's not a very expensive process
      so you are fine with going half way down if you feel like it)
      Don't go to much towards 0 if possible since at very low rates you can get to the moment when
      krita event loop is as fast as this timer and the rotation will thus fail
